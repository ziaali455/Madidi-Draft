**Madidi** is an app that attempts to solve food waste by connecting 
farmers in rural Ghana to a online workspace for tracking their crops
with AI tools. In addition, the app will feature a team organizer that gives
farmers a realtime method of tracking crop count, employee availability, and
customer chat. For farmers in Ghana tackling alarming rates of food waste,
Madidi attempts to simplify the farming process and get more food in the hands
of those who need it while benefitting farmers in the process.
