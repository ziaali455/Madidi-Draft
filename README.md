Madidi is an app that attempts to solve food waste by connecting 
farmers in rural Ghana to a online workspace for tracking their crops
with AI tools. For decades, communities in Ghana have suffered not from a lack
of crop growth, but instead a mismanagement of perfectly consumable goods that go
to waste and leave many citizens hungry. The Madidi app will feature a team organizer that gives
farmers a realtime method of tracking crop count, employee availability, and potential
customers. For farmers in Ghana tackling alarming rates of food waste,
Madidi attempts to simplify the farming process and get more food in the hands
of those who need it while benefitting farmers in the process.

## Notes

Some challenges were encountered when setting up XCode but I was able to find fixes online.
